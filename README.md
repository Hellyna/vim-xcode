# xcodebuild.vim

Plugin for building and testing Xcode projects from within Vim


## Installation

Recommended installation with [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```vim
Plugin 'gfontenot/vim-xcodebuild'
```

## Usage

`xcodebuild.vim` is a thin wrapper around `xcodebuild` itself. It dynamically
finds the project in the current working directory (with support for
workspaces as well) and builds the first scheme it finds.

 - `XBuild` will build the project
 - `XTest` will test the project in the iOS simulator

### `xcpretty` support

[`xcpretty`] is a gem for improving the output of xcodebuild. By default, if you
have it installed, `xcodebuild.vim` will pipe all `xcodebuild` output through
`xcpretty` with the `--color` flag.

If you'd like to customize the output from `xcpretty`, you can do so by
setting a couple of global variables in your `vimrc`:

 - `g:xcodebuild_xcpretty_flags` will be passed to build and test commands. By
   default, this is `--color`.
 - `g:xcodebuild_xcpretty_test_flags` will be passed to test commands only. By
   default, this is empty.

See the [`xcpretty` formatting documentation][xcpretty-doc] for available
options.
